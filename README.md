# ecosystem-classification
use google map images to train a machine learning model to classify google maps images by ecosystems.
## contribute
As of now, I am just getting started with this project, but here are the things I could really use some help with.  
**1)** gathering images from google \
  Images should be extracted from google maps.  
  The ratio of each image will be resized to 300X300  
  avoid images that contain obvious man-made objects or are of bad quality.  
**2)** trianing the machine with the images
  I am fairly new to machine learning, if someone wants to tweek and retrain the models I would be greatful.
